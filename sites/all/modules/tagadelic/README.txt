Tagadelic is a small module, without any databases or configuration, that generates pages with weighted tags.

Tagadelic is an out of the box, ready to use module if you want simple weighted tag clouds. With or without some small CSS modifications this will probably suit most cases. 

Tagadelic is also an API system, and you can pass your queries to the APIs and get weighted clouds of virtually anything: clouds by amount of views, clouds for a certain user, etc. The module does not do all this by default, but you can make it do more with a little coding.
